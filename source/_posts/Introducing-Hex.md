Recently I've been working on [Hex][Hex Play Store], a Hacker News reader for Android. Here is is in action:

Hex's current feature set includes:

- A beautiful, fast-loading front page with feature graphics
- A distraction free reading experience
- Easy swiping between articles and comments
- Tap-to-collapse comment threads
- Simple article and comment sharing

You can get the app today on the [Google Play Store][Hex Play Store].

## Overchoice

The is _plenty_ of choice when it comes to Hacker News apps but there are a few itches I'm hoping to scratch with Hex:

- Create something which is a joy to use
- Provide a solid core experience for reading Hacker News
- Enrich the existing browse and reading experiences
- Explore new experiences (made possible by [Hacker News's official API][Hacker News API GitHub])

These goals will guide Hex's development and roadmap in the months to come. I'm particularly excited about what can be done within the latter two!

## Next

There are lots of new features and improvements planned for Hex. If you'd like to know what's coming up the whole development process is [public][Hex Github], and if you've got ideas for where Hex should go I'd love to [hear them][Hex GitHub Issues]! I'm also warmly welcoming anybody wanting to contribute to the project in any way, shape or form. I'm looking forward for what's to come next for Hex :)
