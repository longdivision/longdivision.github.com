I've spent the last month learning Go on and off. There are some incredibly useful resources out there and I wanted to share some of those that I found in transitioning from _proficient in other languages_ to Go.


## Language

The official Go Tour is a perfect first port of call. The tour is well thought out and introduces you to the language feature-by-feature without overwhelming. It's succinct and gives great examples, so ideal for getting to grips with the primitives that make up golang.

## Internals

Digging a bit deeper into internals

## Design

I wanted to familiarise myself with some of the design patterns and conventions of go projects
