I am a software developer and technology enthusiast based in London. I currently work for [Trail][Trail].

I maintain a handful of [open source projects][GitHub repos] including [Hex][Hex] - a snappy and fun Hacker News reader.

You can find me on [Twitter][Twitter], [GitHub][GitHub] and [LinkedIn][LinkedIn].
